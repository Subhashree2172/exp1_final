# Round 2

### 1.Story Outline

#### Signal Measurement And Analysis:
Information or data in the form of signals,marks the origin of any communication system,that necessitates the transfer of this data from source to destination.Signal can take various forms and hence the processing.We are in need to measure the signal using the parameters defined and analyse them in order to proceed with further processing.

### 2.Story

The story should cover some key points, they are:

#### Visual stage description:
Setup consists of a function generator as signal source which generates signal of various forms whose frequency and amplitude could be varied to have a thorough analysis of every type of signal.The same could be connected to Cathode ray oscilloscope to view,measure and analyse the signal parameters

#### User Objectives and Goals:

 - State the definition and sense of signal
 - Familiarise with the front panel details of function Generator,Cathode ray oscilloscope and Regulated power supply.
 - Recall signal parameters like Amplitude,frequency,time period,peak to peak value.
 - Measure the parameters from the display study its behaviour
 - Analyse the signal for varied frequency and/or amplitude conditions for varied functions.
 - Model a system based on design equations and construct the same
 - Measure the input and output to a system and work out a relation between the two.
 - Verify whether the system works as per the design.

#### Pathway Activities - Experiment 1:

 - Connecting probe is also included to enable connection between the equipment. Power supply also provided to power up the equipment.
 - The front panel of the equipment are opened up. Function selection keys are used to select various functions. Frequency and amplitude of the signal could be varied using suitable provisions, that are assigned.
 - The connections are made and front panel adjustments are familiarised.
 - The displayed waveform is adjusted suitably to have comfortable measurements.
 - The various signal parameters like amplitude, time period, frequency, Peak to peak voltage is measured and displayed.
 - Observations are noted down and the output is studied.

#### Conclusion
Time required to perform the virtual experiment.
It will take 5 mins approximately to understand the procedure to perform the experiment. To generate data will take another 5 min. Calculating and entering the values of various entities in the Result table will take approximately 5 min. It will take about 5 mins to answer the assessment questions. Thus, the total time required to perform the experiment will require around 20 min.
